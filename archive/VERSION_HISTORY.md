## v4.1 (Jun 12 – Jun 23, 2026)

**Archive:** `archive/v4.1/`  
**Base commit:** `766b013` (Jun 12, 2026) — devig formula + cap tightening + results workflow  
**Picks resolved:** 609 Bet/Lean (445 Bet, 164 Lean) | 2,541 total tracked

### Performance

| Tier | W | L | Win% | Net Units | ROI |
|------|--:|--:|-----:|----------:|----:|
| Bet  | 64 | 381 | 14.4% | −1.04u | −10.3% |
| Lean | 19 | 145 | 11.6% | −0.12u | −10.9% |
| **Combined** | **83** | **526** | **13.6%** | **−1.16u** | **−10.4%** |

### Calibration

- Brier Score: **0.11228** vs baseline 0.11154 → Skill Score **−0.007** (essentially no calibration advantage)
- 20%+ probability bin: predicted avg 26.7%, actual HR rate 18.4% → **+8.3pp systematic overestimate**
- 0–5% bin: predicted 2.3%, actual 7.4% → **−5.1pp underestimate** (less consequential)
- Bins 10–20% are roughly calibrated (within ±3pp)

### Known issues carried into v4.2

1. **Caesars outlier contamination** — Single-book Caesars lines created phantom +15–26pp edge; +10pp+ picks performed worse than Skip-tier picks. Fixed in v4.2 by multi-book corroboration filter.
2. **Window field null throughout** — All picks saved with window=None due to missing `--window` arg in workflow. Fixed in v4.2 by auto-detecting window from UTC time.
3. **Low odds match rate** (~63% average, 10/12 days below 80%) — Corollary of #2: 11:30am run fires before books post props. Fixed in v4.2 by proper window tracking.
4. **Factor values not logged** — No per-pick factor breakdown; per-factor calibration analysis not possible. Fixed in v4.2 by adding `factors` dict to each pick record.
5. **per_pa cap saturation** — Hard cap at 0.08 causes identical probs across dates for top-end players (confirmed: Rodolfo Durán, player_id 660710). Not a caching bug — model saturation. Flagged in v4.2 via `per_pa_capped` field.
